        <h2>The Ion Thruster</h2>
        <p>
            Taking a peek into the world of Star wars or Star Trek the ion thruster seems or rather sounds like something right out of one of
             these movies. Going into what it actually is, the ion thruster is an engine that is capable of producing thrust in a way which 
             may seem a bit unconventional from the normal means by which we have established propulsion in the past, like with the use of jet 
             engines or rocket engines. Unlike its predecessors the ionic thruster does not rely on the combustion of fuel to produce thrust; 
             rather it relies on the propulsion, ionization, acceleration and neutralization of an ion of an element, most preferably Xenon.

        <h3>Stages of Ionic Thrust</h3>
        <div id="section-II">
            <p><b>Propulsion:</b><br> During this stage xenon atoms are shot out, along with electrons, into a positively charged chamber surrounded 
                externally with magnets.<br></p>
        
            <p><b>Ionization:</b><br> Once in the chamber the electrons move randomly towards the walls of the chamber as a result of the 
                positive charge of the walls and due to the presence of the magnets outside the chamber, a positive magnetic field is generated,
                 which in turn increases the speed of the electrons random movement.<br>  
                As the electrons move about in the chamber they tend to make multiple collisions with the Xenon atoms, which results in the formation of a 
                positively charged Xenon ion because the collisions caused by the electrons knock off electrons in the valence shell of the Xenon atoms.<br></p> 
            
            <img src="../images/reaction.png" style="height:20%; width:60%; margin: 2% 0 2% 15%; ">    

            <p><b>Acceleration:</b><br> The positively charged Xenon ions then move towards the second stage of the thruster as they still 
                retain their momentum after having been propelled into the first chamber. The second chamber being the accelerator is composed 
                of two electrodes with opposite charges separated by a given distance. These electrodes also have holes punctured through them, 
                which allow for the Xenon ions to move through the electrodes.<br> The space in between the electrodes has an induced potential 
                difference due to the difference in the charges of the electrodes. Once the Xenon ion makes its way into this region through 
                the first positively charged electrode, it accelerates toward the negatively charged electrode and passes through the holes, 
                thus making its exit out of the thruster.<br></p>

            <img src="../images/electrode.png" style="height:20%; width:60%; margin: 2% 0 2% 15%;">
        
            <p><b>Neutralization:</b><br> Once the Xenon ions are outside the thruster it is neutralized by electrons getting shot out near the 
                exit hole of the electrode. The neutralization of the Xenon ions is done so as to prevent the ions from falling back towards the 
                negatively charged electrode.<br></p>
        
            <p>Now that this process is completed thrust is produced following Newton's third law of motion.</p>
